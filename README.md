# Hi, I'm Praveen Raja ðŸ‘‹

I'm a deep learning engineer who loves to explore new challenges and learn new things. My expertise lies in Computer Vision, NLP, NeRF, Generative AI and I'm particularly enthusiastic about Transformer neural nets and applying them on various domains. 


## ðŸš€ Some of my projects

- Deep Reinforcement Learning: Applied DQN algorithm on Pong Environment: A project where I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to play the classic Atari game Pong.
- Relational-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Attention-models: A project where I explored the use of attention mechanisms to enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents in relational environments.
- Image-Self-Supervised-Learning-with-Pytorch-Lightning: A project where I experimented with different self-supervised learning methods for image representation learning using PyTorch Lightning.

## ðŸ“š What I'm currently learning

- Currently, I'm immersed in personal projects that revolve around tranformers, graph neural networks, geomteric deep learning and the fascinating world of NeRF. My deep interest in transformers and self-attention mechanisms drives my pursuit of understanding their applications and potential in various AI domains.
