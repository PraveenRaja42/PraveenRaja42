# Hi, I'm Praveen Raja ðŸ‘‹

I'm a deep learning engineer who loves to explore new challenges and learn new things. I'm passionate about computer vision, natural language processing, NeRF, and I enjoy applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸš€ Some of my projects

- Deep Reinforcement Learning: Applied DQN algorithm on Pong Environment: A project where I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to play the classic Atari game Pong.
- Relational-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-using-Attention-models: A project where I explored the use of attention mechanisms to enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents in relational environments.
- Image-Self-Supervised-Learning-with-Pytorch-Lightning: A project where I experimented with different self-supervised learning methods for image representation learning using PyTorch Lightning.

## ðŸ“š What I'm currently learning

- I'm working on personal projects using transformers, graph neural networks, geometric deep learning and nerf. 

## ðŸ’» My tech stack

- Languages: Python
- Frameworks: PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, OpenCV
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
